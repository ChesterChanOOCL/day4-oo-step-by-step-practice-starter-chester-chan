### Objective
Today I worked on refining a Java School-Klass-Teacher-Students classes to meet the OOP and test requirements. We also learned to work under Retrospective agile programming.
In the project, We implemented multiple classes and fixed issues in these classes and added generics to lists for type safety.


### Reflective
  - Passionate
  
### Interpretive
I' ve learned the importance of using generics in Java to ensure type safety and to structure a class to meet specific requirements and how to write effective unit tests.
For the retrospective session, we experienced the benefits of collaboration and continuous improvement under an Agile environment after 1 or 2 weeks of sprints, in order to review our progress and wrap up for the future tasks.
I have also looked into how to make test case for OOP to verify the functionality.

### Decisional

I will apply the use of generics consistently in future Java projects to avoid type-related issues.
and from now on share my learnings with my team to help improve overall code quality.
